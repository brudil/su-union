# Quick Start

Install dependencies with
```bash
$ yarn
```

Setup a few things using
```bash
$ yarn setup
```

We've built `comp` to manage our build process. To start comp with the development server:

```bash
$ yarn serve
```

Woo! Have a gander at `http://localhost:3002`.

This is sussexstudent.com using locally built assets and a locally generated base template. The content is proxied from the live site.

To aid in developing pages, locally rendered pages can be accessed under the `/~/` path, for example `http://localhost:3002/~/get-involved` - this uses generators `get-involved` template to build this file.
