                Falmer Bar and East Slope over the last couple of years have
                significantly changed their menus to support a variety of diets.
                They are continuing to expand their menu with vegetarian and
                vegan specials after the positive feedback from the meat-free

              <p>
                The SU has ethical procurement and purchasing guidelines which
                suggests products and brands and companies to purchase from and
                ones to avoid; staff are encouraged to follow this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our ethical and environmental policy highlights this as
                something we will continue to improve on where possible across a
                range of items.

                The Union is researching the possibilities of supplying 100%

              </p>
              <p>
                All our outlets and shop provide a range of products which may
                be organic, recycled and/or be made from less harmful
                materials/chemicals. In regards to food and drink, the Union
                provide a range of local, vegetarian, vegan, organic and /or
                Fairtrade products. The Union act in response to the student
                voice on whether certain brands should be boycotted in the
                Union’s outlets.

                The SU carried out research, with the support Sussex Estates and
                Facilities (SEF), on student attitudes and behaviours towards
                recycling in the Lewes Court residences 2015/16.
              </p>
              <p>
                In November 2016 all student residences on campus were provided
                with more recycling bags/boxes. From these improvements, SEF
                have reported for February 2017 an 89% increase in glass
                recycling and 42% increase in mixed recycling from February
                2016.

              <p>
                New bins are being installed internally and externally across
                campus which aim to encourage improved behaviours towards

                The plan is for all student kitchens on campus to have a food
                caddy for food collection for the start of next academic year
                (Sept 2017). The Union outlets have their food waste collected
                by Brighton Paper Round.
