There are a few different accounts staff may have, depending on access and areas required.

## MSL Admin (bluescreens)
MSL Admin is used for managing MSL Memberships and more. These have superceeded the MSL Windows Applications.

## Website
Website referes to access and log in via sussexstudent.com. This largely focuses on MSL's website features, such as content, news and events.

## Falmer
Falmer is the in-house content server and refers to the digital services we run (rather than MSL or third parties). Falmer accounts are required for Wagtail content and to have access to the management panel for Falmer services.
