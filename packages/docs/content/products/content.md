To allow for high quality content pages that are easy to manage, a CMS has been introduced. MSL's webpage editor is a CKEditor. This meant pages were often broken on mobile, poor with accessibility and inconsistent on design.

Content is powered by Wagtail, a Django-based CMS. Wagtail uses a tree for page structure but page types are defined as code translating to actual database tables.
