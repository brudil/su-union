MSL provides no API for student groups data. For integration with Falmer services, we run a web scraping script every hour within Falmer.

This allows us to 'use and enhance', using MSL's data while still being able to develop our own additional features.

## API

## Discover (SGD)
Discover is our listings module. Consuming the Falmer API we offer listings, client-based search.

Next up is filtering.
